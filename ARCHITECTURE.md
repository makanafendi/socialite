# Socialite Application Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of the Socialite application after the refactoring process.

## Architecture Overview

The application now follows a clean layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Controllers** - Handle HTTP requests and route them to appropriate services
2. **Services** - Contain business logic and orchestrate operations
3. **Repositories** - Handle data access and persistence
4. **DTOs** - Transfer data between layers in a consistent format
5. **Models** - Represent database entities and relationships

## Architectural Layers

### Presentation Layer

- **Controllers** - Thin controllers that validate input and delegate to services
- **Views** - Blade templates for rendering HTML
- **Response DTOs** - Standardized response formats

### Business Logic Layer

- **Services** - Business logic encapsulated in service classes
- **DTOs** - Data Transfer Objects for moving data between layers

### Data Access Layer

- **Repositories** - Encapsulate data access logic
- **Models** - Eloquent models with relationships and query scopes

## Key Components

### Services

- **ProfileService** - Handles profile-related operations
- **ImageService** - Processes and stores images
- **FollowService** - Manages follow relationships

### Repositories

- **UserRepository** - Handles User data access

### DTOs

- **ApiResponse** - Standardizes API response format

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
- **Feature Tests** - Test full request/response cycles
- **Integration Tests** - Test components working together

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain
2. **Testability** - Services and repositories can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability** - Business logic can be reused across different controllers
4. **Scalability** - New features can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Readability** - Code is more organized and follows consistent patterns

## Future Improvements

1. **Command Bus Pattern** - Implement for complex operations
2. **Event Sourcing** - Track state changes over time
3. **CQRS** - Separate read and write operations for scalability
4. **API Versioning** - Support multiple API versions for backward compatibility
5. **Caching Strategy** - Implement more advanced caching for better performance
